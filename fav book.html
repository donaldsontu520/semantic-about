             <h3>book description</h3>
 
            <h4>The book is called trinkets by Kristen Smith, this book is a fiction book and the books main 3 characters are Tabitha, Elodie, and Moe. Moe has brown curly hair, skinny, seems about 5,5 and has blue eyes, Elodie has a pixie cut, brown eyes, sharp chin, seems about 5,4 close to Moe. Tabitha has brown skin, frizzy brown hair, brown eyes, seems around 5,4 like Elodie. The plot is about 3 girls who are very different but love to steal so they do just that but together, they keep secrets from their parents so they do not get caught. I learned not to steal, that is for sure, they stole some very expensive clothing and jewelry, also since it is a crime too. I would rate this book a â…— because it has a good plot but seems slow at times and not new things happening but it has very good character development.
