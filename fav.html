            <h3>Cupcake boss project </h3>

            <h3>My favorite project that I have done was the cupcake boss project and it was about the culinary class doing a competition with making cupcakes and themes with their cupcakes and using teamwork to beat the other groups in the best cupcake. The project was about making a google site about the cupcake boss and doing a description and images and such. It is my favorite cause I love cupcakes and especially because it is like other flavors of cupcakes that I did not even think of. I really liked this project because it helped me learn about teamwork.  </h3>
