            <h2>My life goals</h2>

    
            <h3>My smart goals</h3>

<h3>An academic smart goal I have is to finish high school with a good GPA and to get into a good modeling agency. It is very important to me because I thought that I wanted to become a stay at home dad and just live off my future lover's money but from getting my own money this year I really liked knowing that I can make money on my own and that I really should have my own career. A personal goal I have for myself is to become a more honest and confident person. I want to be able to not have anxiety when telling someone anything I do not like about them. It is important to me because I have spent since 6th grade always putting my feelings last, it really puts on a weight when ur around people you donâ€™t even like. A long term smart goal I have is that I want to live my best life from here on, I want to put myself and my feelings first and not others. It is important to me because I want to be happy and living my best life and not putting others before my own happiness.</h3>
